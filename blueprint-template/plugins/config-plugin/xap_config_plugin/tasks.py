# called out in the relationship declaration.

# Note that the relationship plugin execution is controlled by
# the blueprint declaration and may be called before or after
# the nodes are configured.  Since this recipe is using the
# bash plugin, whatever info I discover here must be written
# somewhere a bash script can get it (the filesystem for example).

# In this case, "runtime_properties" is being accessed, and it
# must be set via the REST API in the target node.
