# This operation is just a generic implementation that executes an
# arbitrary script.  When porting, you could repurpose this to point

    # for lifecycle scripts referenced by the bash plugin; if those scripts
    # access other scripts in the directory structure, you have to manually
    # download them prior to execution.
