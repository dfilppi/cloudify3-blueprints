This is a blueprint for installing XAP on 2 pre-provisioned Windows machines.

Prerequisites
2 Windows 2012 machines with WinRM enabled and Python 2.7 installed.
init.ps1 script may be used to perform the initial setup.
2 GB and 1 GB of RAM are advised for manager and grid nodes respectively.


Agent Installation
Agent is installed into C:\CloudifyAgent. Use celery.log for troubleshooting.


Java Installation
jdk_download_url should point to a zip file containing JDK msi and cab files.
This differs from a regular Windows JDK installer since it is an exe file that 
extracts msi and cabs into a temporary dir. For details, check
http://www.74k.org/extracting-java-msi-from-java-exe

JDK installer name is hardcoded to jdk1.7.0_79.msi (not configurable).


XAP
XAP zip is expected to contain gigaspaces-xap-premium-10.1.1-ga (not 
configurable). Archive is extracted to C:\gs.

Web UI is started on the manager node and is available on port 8099.


Networking
Unicast discovery is used in the setup, so multicast support is not required.
Windows machines must be able to resolve each others hostnames. If this is not 
true, etc/hosts manipulation is required.


Security
WinRM is used in HTTP with basic authentication, so Windows username and 
password information is transmitted as cleartext. Because of that, the 
communication between Cloudify manager and Windows hosts has to be done over a 
secure channel (not Internet).
For proper XAP node discovery, Windows firewall is being disabled during 
installation.
